Some basic Operations of Computer system is required to understand the working of Operating system well.

-- normally a modern OS consist of more than one CPU (PRocessor) and device Controller connected
   to common bus that provide access to shared memory.


  - Each device controller will take care of specific devise like (disk controller will take care of Hard disk resouce requiement etc..)
  - CPU and device controller work concurrently.  that is the reason we can swith between multiple application at same time without hampering any thing
    - ex: if we are playing vedio in broser we can minimise it and work on Word file typing etc..

  - we have memory controller to handle the memory requists.



  There are some important Terms to Know :

  1. Bootstrap Program :
    - this is an initial program which runs when computer is powered on
	- it is stored in ROM
	- it must locate OS and Load OS kernal into Memory for excution.

  2. Interrupt :
    - the events occured by hardware are called interupts
	- in interrupt the hardware send signal to the CPU though system BUS.
	- example : clicking somewhere on the screen using Mouse, or click keyborad button etc..

  3. System calls (Monitor calls):
   - Usually the interupts caused by software are called system calls.


   When the CPU is Interrupted (hardware or software) then it stops what it is doing and transfer execution to specific location.
    - the fixed location contains code to execute that perticular interupt.
	- after execution of that interupt it resumes its interupted computation.
