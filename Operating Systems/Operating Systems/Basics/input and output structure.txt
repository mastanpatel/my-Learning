- storage is one of I/O devices of computer.
 
- large portion of OS code dedicated to managing I/O. because of its importance to the releiabilty & performance of System. 
  and varying nature of devices connected to system.

- a general pupose computer consist of CPU's and I/O devices and its Controller connected through a common BUS (an connected path).

-each devide controller is incharge of specific type of device

-- typically OS have a device drivers for each device controller. drivers help in better and smooth communication between OS and device.

       Device controller -> Device Driver -> Operating System 



	---------very important---------------- Working of I/O operation ----------------------------------------------

	1. to start I/O operation a device driver load appropriete registers within the device controller

	2. next the device controller examine the content of these registers to determine what action to take.

	3. now the controller start to transfer data from device to its local buffer.

	4. once the transfer of data is complete the controller informs device trogh an interupt that it has finished the operation.

	5. then device driver return control to OS.


	-- the above working model is not efficient for Large Data I/O operation
	 so to overcome or solve that problem we use DMA (direct memeroy access).
