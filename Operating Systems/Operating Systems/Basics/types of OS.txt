there are various types of OS 

lets start history of Operating system.

1. MainFrame Systems:
   
   - these kind of system are initial OS where I/P and O/P where Punch Card passed as input and got the Result as Punchcard (output)
   - thease system had very limited memory
   - the main disadvantage was cpu was idle for most of the time because the i/p and o/p was very slow compare to processing.
   - and there was very limited use of OS (only used to manage one process a time)

   Next to overcome these limitations we introdused Batch Systems

2. Batch OS:
   
   - Here the main changes are multiple jobs of similar jobs are processed at a time.
   - here multiple user sumbit there jobs and operator will sort them into similar job batches for processing.

   - the advantage was we have improved the cpu usage. but still needed some improvement.

   -- next to overcome the limitations we intoduced Spooling.


----------------------------------------more changes happended here --- memory wise in spooling-----------------------------

3. Spooling :
  
   - Here the main changes is we inroduced the concept of Disk (secondary memory).
   - the I/P and O/P will Happen from Disk memory.
   - the INteraction between Disk memory and Main Memory(RAM) is much Faster than interaction between i/p devices
     so all I/P are stored in Disk which are used by main memory for processing.

  - we have resolved the most issue. like (memory issue and CPU idle time).
  - but still the area of improvement was -> the processor is able to process only one Process at a time which causes the CPU to be idle
    where process is perform other i/p o/p task.
  
  - to overcome above problem we inroduced the Multiprogramming Concept.


4. Multiprogramming :

  - Here mostly a single processor will handle one process (job) at a time but we have context switching concept here.
  - we load multiple jobs in the main memory.
  - if one job (process) is not interacting with Processor (ex: need input from external devices like keyboard)  then processor will pick other process
    from the main memory.
  
  - here the next process (job) is picked if previous process is not in use.
  - so her user get the feel of multiple task are performed at once.
  - the problem here is we have to wait till process which is running finishes its job.
  - to overcome this problem we have inroduced multitaking systems.

5. Multitasking or Time sharing OS:
  
  - Here the concept of Multiprogramming and time sharing (scheduling) are combined to perform context switch very quickly between jobs.
   so that user can interact many programm at once.
   ex:- vedio playing in VLC and Browsing etc...

  - scheduling:- the scheduling of jobs which are loaded in the main memory is done using different algorithms

  - Next main changes were done in the processor stage where we increased the number of processor call multiprocessor OS

6. MultiProcessor OS:

 - Here we have more than two Processor running parallel. within single computer and OS.
 - multiprocessor means multiple CPU ex: dual core, quad core etc....
 - the problem here is we have to increase the Main memory because er have to Load more number of processes in the memory because we have muliple
   processors

   - there are two types of muliprocessing systems
     - Symmatric (all have equal rights) -- it is more complex to implement
	 - asymmatric (Master slave aarchitecture) -- easy to design


- Advantage of Multiprocess OS
  - it is more efficient
  - it is very Fast
  - it is reliable (if one processor fails the ther processor will take care).
  - cost saving   --> istread of using four different computers we can add four cpu in one computer and get same results
  - high troughput
  - battery efficient
  - true parallel processing
