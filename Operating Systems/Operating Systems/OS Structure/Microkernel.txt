Kernel :
is the core part of an operating system which manages system resources.
It also acts like a bridge between application and hardware of the computer. 
It is one of the first programs loaded on start-up (after the Bootloader).

there are various ways the OS is Strucutred.

some of them are 

1. Simple OS strcture : DOS OS
  -- here the application program can access the Hardware Direclty. if any error occures in Application program lead to whole system being Down.

2. Monolithic OS strucuture : 
-- Here mostly we have all the services packed in the Kernal. and Application are requisting these services from kernal and 
   kernal is interacting with hardware to provide services requisted by applicaiton.

3. Layered OS strucuture :
-- Here each part of OS is Kept in deferent layers. the lowest layer is Hardware and Top layer is Application Layer and Kernal comes inbetween these two.
-- it should be designed very carefully.

4. Microkernel OS structure : latest and Famous
-- 


Kernel mode and User mode of CPU operation :
- The operating system puts the CPU in kernel mode when it is executing in the kernel 
  so, that kernel can execute some special operation.
- The operating system puts the CPU in user mode when a user program is in execution 
  so, that user program cannot interface with the operating system program.


- System calls are typically implemented in the form of software interrupts, 
-	which causes the hardware’s interrupt handler to transfer control over to an appropriate interrupt handler, 
-	which is part of the operating system, switching the mode bit to kernel mode in the process. 
-	The interrupt handler checks exactly which interrupt was generated, 
-	checks additional parameters ( generally passed through registers ) if appropriate, and 
-	then calls the appropriate kernel service routine to handle the service requested by the system call.



--------------------------------------------------- Important learning Microkernel ------------------------------------------

What is Microkernel?
	Microkernel is one of the classification of the kernel. 
	Being a kernel it manages all system resources. 
	But in a microkernel, the user services and kernel services are implemented in different address space. 
	The user services are kept in user address space, 
	and kernel services are kept under kernel address space, 
	thus also reduces the size of kernel and size of operating system as well.


The Operating System remains unaffected as user services and kernel services are isolated 
so if any user service fails it does not affect kernel service. 

microkernel is easily extendable i.e. 
if any new services are to be added they are added to user address space and hence requires no modification in kernel space.
It is also portable, secure and reliable.


Microkernel Architecture :–
Since kernel is the core part of the operating system, so it is meant for handling the most important services only.
Thus in this architecture only the most important services are inside kernel and 
rest of the OS services are present inside system application program. 
Thus users are able to interact with those not-so important services within the system application.
And the microkernel is solely responsible for the most important services of operating system.


most important services of operating system :
	- Inter process-Communication
	- Memory Management
	- CPU-Scheduling
