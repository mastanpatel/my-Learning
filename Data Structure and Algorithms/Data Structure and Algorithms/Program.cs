             It is an Method of Storing and Organising a Data so that it can be used efficieantly.


            we Talk about Data Strucures in two ways:

            1.Abstract type also known as (ADT) abstract data type
              where we have the operation and features of Data structure
            2. Implemetation of Data structure is done using any Language like c#, python etc.. 
             (implemetating how to organise and operation of perticular data strucutre)


            What is an Abstract Data Type:
            -> it define Data and Operations on that data wirhot Implemetation.

            How we Study Data Strucutres

            1. we Study Logical View of Data Strucutre
            2. we Study various operations done on Data structure
            3. we Study Cost of Operations (Time and Memory Complexity of Data Structure)
            4. we Implement these Data Structure using C#

                                     1. Arrays  -- 19
                                        - Subarray with given sum -- (i have learn't to make code funtional and first solve for small input and them using brutforce or
                                          whatever method hit u at that point
                                          and then try to Optimise it (Time Comlexity and Space complexity) --> look at the Operations Performed on each element at worst case and try to reduce it.

                                        - Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm -- (solved it '\/' and learnt to minimise the steps (reduce the lines of code and remove unnessary things, use inbuild funtionality of c#,
                                                                 try to cover all corner cases.)
