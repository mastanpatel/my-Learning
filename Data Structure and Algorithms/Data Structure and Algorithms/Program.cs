            // we Talk about Data Strucures in two ways:

            // 1.Abstract type also known as (ADT) abstract data type
            //   where we have the operation and features of Data structure
            // 2. Implemetation of Data structure is done using any Language like c#, python etc.. 
            //  (implemetating how to organise and operation of perticular data strucutre)


            // What is an Abstract Data Type:
            // -> it define Data and Operations on that data wirhot Implemetation.

            // How we Study Data Strucutres

            // 1. we Study Logical View of Data Strucutre
            // 2. we Study various operations done on Data structure
            // 3. we Study Cost of Operations (Time and Memory Complexity of Data Structure)
            // 4. we Implement these Data Structure using C#



            // *** Very Important Lesson***//   //*** Interview wise and Competative Programing Wise***//

            // Take the Given Problem (Understand Problem thoroughly.
            // List Down Type of Data and Operations needed in this Problem and Size of the Data.
            // identify the most Heavily(Frequient) performed Operation (insertion, deletion, iteration etc...)
            // choose the Basic Data Strucutre mostly suited to implement above mevtioned Data strucuture and its Operations
            // with efficient cost (less costly)
            // choose to implement From primitive sata strucute like (Array, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph, Hash etc....)
            // Optimise if any where Required.
